# Nascimento Rodrigo - Portfolio - Section B

**Objective:** Creation of a website to show my design work, both from the Interactive Media Design course and for real clients. This project helped me enhance my skills in UX/UI, Graphic Design, Motion Design, Front-end programming (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, and tools like Greensock), and Back-end development (PHP and MySQL).

## About Me

I'm Rodrigo Nascimento, or just "Rodri". I'm 42 years old and I'm from Brazil.

My professional goal is to work as a Product Designer (UX/UI) in Canada. I've always been curious and eager to get into this industry. Previously in my career (before I arrived in Canada), I was a digital project coordinator and worked in the marketing department of a large company. These experiences gave me a great foundation in management, success metrics, customer experience and even Design concepts as I worked next and managed designers in Digital Agencies.

I believe I can be very successful in the UX/UI field or as a Product Designer, since my passion for solving problems through Design combined with my strategic vision and new knowledge acquired in the course (in all disciplines), accredit me as a professional capable of this challenge.
